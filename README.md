## Features

- User Authentication: Users can log in with their email and view personalized content
- Subject-based Quizzes: Quizzes are categorized by subjects like Math, Science, and Social Science.
- Dynamic User Interface: User's name is dynamically displayed on the dashboard after login.



## Technologies Used

**Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (for dynamic interaction), FontAwesome (for icons), Google Fonts (for custom fonts).

**Backend:** PHP, MySQL.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-web-app.git
```

2. Set up the environment:
Make sure you have PHP and MySQL installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, you can use XAMPP or WAMP for local development.

3. Configure the database:
Create a database in MySQL and import the necessary tables. Hereâ€™s an example of a user table structure:

```bash
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT(11) PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    firstname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    lastname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

4. Update the database connection:
In your PHP script, update the database connection settings ($conn) to match your local environment:

```bash
$conn = mysqli_connect("localhost", "root", "", "quiz");
```

5. Run the project:
Once the environment is set up and the database is configured, you can run the project on your local server (e.g., localhost or localhost/quiz).
## Usage
